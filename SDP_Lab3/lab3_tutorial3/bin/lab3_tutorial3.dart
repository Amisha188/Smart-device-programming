  /*
  // Dart strings are a collection of UTF-16 code units.
  // (ASCII value)UTF-16 is a way to encode Unicode values by using 16-bit numbers. If you want to find out what those UTF-16 codes are, you can do it like so:

  var salutation = 'Hello!';
  print(salutation.codeUnits);

  // However, 16 bits only give you 65,536 combinations, and believe it or not, there are more than 65,536 characters in the world!
  // so,Youâ€™ll need more than 16 bits to represent those values.
  // Surrogate pairs => UTF-16 has a special way of encoding code points higher than 65,536 by using two code units called as Surrogate pairs.
  const dart = 'ðŸŽ¯';
  print(dart.codeUnits);

  // runes => It would give Unicode code points directly,much nicer to just get it.
  print(dart.runes);

  // Regional Indicator symbols => It is pair of code points to represents flag.
  // 127474 is the code for the regional indicator symbol letter M, and 127475 is the code for the regional indicator symbol letter N. MN represents Mongolia.
